# Webpage Refresher (jQuery)

## About

A program to reload the current webpage, made using jQuery.

## Useful Information

The script utilises the `location.reload()` method, emulating a click of the reload button by the user, and causing the browser to refresh. The addition of the `true` parameter forces the page to load from the server and ignore the browser cache.

## Instructions for Use

Simply navigate to `src`, download the program file, and run in your terminal.
